# calcback
*Currently not working as intended*
* What is calcback?
A tool to calculate the refractive indices of a layer, by using the ellipsometric parameters Delta and Psi 

Input should be a .csv file containing the following data:

wavelenght,psi,delta

You can use the "300nmSiO2.csv" as an example file, plotted it looks like this (Delta might need to get multiplied by -1)

* TODO Work in Progress:
 - [ ] check the formulas, get the right results (at first just for SiO2, with just real n_L)
 - [ ] Use complex refractive index, not just real(n_L)
 - [ ] Use different resolutions of n_L, to minimize ammount of calculations
 - [ ] add concurrency (for each lambda, maybe each calc_ho())
 - [ ] Output (lambda, n, k) into a .csv


* The Goal:
Get a programm to calculate refractive indices for different simulated layers (my python script) made of multiple dielectric/metal periods (eg. 10 times 5nm Ag + 5nm SiO2).

A plot for 300 nm SiO2 on top of a silicon wafer should look like this:
